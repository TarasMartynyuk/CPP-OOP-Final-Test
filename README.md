# CPP-OOP-Final-Test

A long-term home exam with a task to create an object-oriented store simulation to provide items selling and storaging functionality

For date representation i've used [this wonderful chrono wrapper](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date), added, built and linked via CMake.
For my unit tests i've got around with vanilla C++.
I also tried to substitue every single for-loop with a STL algorithm
